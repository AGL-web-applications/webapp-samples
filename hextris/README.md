# About
Hextris was created by a couple high school friends (who are now in college!) who unfortunately don't have as much time to update the game. If you'd like to support the open-source development of Hextris, please consider donating at:

**ETH:** `0xbf5414129552D37B4Fb12D058Cf1596B960d25b2`

Disclosure: Please note that the version on hextris.io uses [Monero](http://coinhive.com) to support the developers. If you'd rather not play that version, an unmonetized version is available to play at: https://hextris.github.io/hextris.
