$.ui.ready - this is similar to $(document).ready but fires after App Framework UI has launched.

If you use data-defer to load content, this launches AFTER all data-defer files are loaded.

If the event has already dispatched and you create a $.ui.ready function, it will execute right away.

```js
$.ui.ready(function(){
    //App is ready lets check if a user exists.
    if(user===false)
       return $.ui.loadContent("#login");
    else
        return $.ui.loadContent("#main");
});
```
