$.ui.finishTransition(oldDiv) must be called at the end of a transition to tell App Framework UI it can continue on.

When you are creating a custom transition, call this at the end with the div being "hidden".

```js
function myNewTransition(){
    //Do transition code

    $.ui.finishTransition(oldDiv);
}
```
