$.bind(object,eventfunction) works the same as $().unbind, except you are unbinding events on JavaScript Objects.


The following will tell the $.touchLayer object to no longer respond to "orientationchange-reshape" events
```
 $.unbind($.touchLayer, 'orientationchange-reshape', orientationChangeProxy);
 ```
