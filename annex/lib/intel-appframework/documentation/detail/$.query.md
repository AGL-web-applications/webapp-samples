$.query(selector,[context]) is faster then using $() to find an element using a query selector.

$() has a lot of logic to handle finding elements, turning arrays/objects into a collection, etc.

$.query lets you jump right to the query selector engine and returns an App Framework collection.  You should use this when possible.


When context is passed in, it must be a DOM node to search within.

```
var divs=$.query("divs");

var elem=$.query("#main");

var lis=$.query("li",$("#main").get(0));
```
