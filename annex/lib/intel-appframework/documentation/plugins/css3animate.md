#CSS3 Animate

## CSS/Customize

Below is an example used by App Framework's iOS7 theme to customize the look and feel of the popup

```

```


## Examples

Here is a basic example that animates a lot of properties.  We will change the height, width, X coords, yCoords and opacity.  At the end, we call reset() that would reset it's position

```
$("#animate").css3Animate({
    width: "100px",
    height: "100px",
    x: "20%",
    y: "30%",
    time: "1000ms",
    opacity: .5,
    success: function () {
        reset()
    }
});
```

Below we use the success callback to run another animation with a delay.  We animate from the previous position.

```
$("#animate").css3Animate({
    x: 20,
    y: 30,
    time: "300ms",
    success: function () {
        $("#animate").css3Animate({
            x: 20,
            y: 30,
            time: "500ms",
            previous: true,
            callback: function () {
                reset();
            }
        });
    }
});
```

Now we will use the animation queue to display multiple animations in a row, all linked together.

```
var tmp = new $.css3AnimateQueue(); //Create a new queue

tmp.push({
    id: "animate",
    x: 20,
    y: 30,
    time: "300ms"
});
tmp.push({
    id: "animate",
    x: 20,
    y: 30,
    time: "500ms",
    previous: true
});
tmp.push({
    id: "animate",
    x: 100,
    y: 100,
    time: "1s"
});
tmp.push(function () {
    reset()
});
tmp.run();
```
