This must be called at the end of every transition to remove all transforms and transitions attached to the inView object (performance + native scroll)

##Parameters

Div                           Object

```

##Returns

```
undefined
```

##Detail

$.ui.finishTransition(oldDiv) must be called at the end of a transition to tell App Framework UI it can continue on.

When you are creating a custom transition, call this at the end with the div being "hidden".

```
function myNewTransition(){
    //Do transition code

    $.ui.finishTransition(oldDiv);
}
```
